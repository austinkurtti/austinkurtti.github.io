                <p>I was born in Kansas, where I lived for several years before moving to Minnesota. After finishing high school, I came back to Kansas to attend college at the University of Kansas. By this time, I had developed a strong sense for math and science and chose to pursue an engineering major.</p>
                <p>It only took one programming class for me to realize that I loved to code. My curiosity for coding was not always satisfied in the classroom, which lead me to explore different languages on my own through personal projects.</p>

                <p>Applying my programming knowledge to practical problems brings me a great sense of accomplishment. Especially when the end results of my work make a positive impact on others.</p>
                <p>Experimenting with new techonology improves my understanding of programming concepts, and I continually strive to keep myself up-to-date on the latest principles and techniques of web development.</p>
