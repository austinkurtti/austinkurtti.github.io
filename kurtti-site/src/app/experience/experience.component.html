                As a web developer intern at AllofE Solutions, I got my first taste of responsibilities such as contributing to the design of new interfaces, updating legacy code and managing diverse databases. The projects I was involved in at AllofE introduced me to modern web technologies and allowed me to build a solid foundation of web development skills.

                It was a privilage to work with AllofE's team of talented developers on a wide array of products. My time there provided invaluable experience for academic work and shaped into a solid platform from which to launch my professional career.

                I currently work at Lockpath as a full-stack software engineer. On day one, I joined the back-end team and developed a good understanding of the business logic behind their flagship product, Keylight. After several months, I switched to focus on front-end work and assist with a crucial UI/UX overhaul for Keylight involving converting the app to Angular.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
                Since then, I have been able to flex my skills on both sides of Keylight. I continue to be involved in the overall Angular conversion while also building and refining associated REST API endpoints. These projects continue to teach me about advanced software architecture principles, modern coding standards and timeline management.
