                    Welcome! My name is Austin Kurtti and I currently live in Lawrence, Kansas as an undergraduate student at the University of Kansas. I am pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Business with the intent to graduate in the spring of 2017. Some of my interests include traveling to new, far away places, hitting the ski slopes every winter, watching KU basketball, and coding cool things! I have been striving to learn more about web development and design in my free time, and also tend to dabble in Android programming when I can.<br><br>Before coming to KU, I was inspired to become an electrical engineer through participation in my high school's engineering club. After the first semester of classes my freshman year, I wasn't as excited to continue with engineering as I thought I would be. But with the help of my first programming class in my second semester, I discovered what I really wanted to study. Within the first couple weeks of that class, I found myself craving homework (I know, right!) and was once again excited to stay in the engineering program. I always viewed programming as a weird foreign language that didn't make any sense, but I realized it's something I love. Before I knew it, I was submitting my request to change majors from electrical engineering to computer science.<br><br>In February of 2014, I started a job with AllofE Solutions in Lawrence, Kansas as a web development intern. After working at AllofE for over a year and a half, I have learned that web design is what I truly enjoy the most. With two years left in my academic career, I look forward to continuing my studies at KU and learning more about the web development industry through my internship with AllofE.<br><br>If you would like to learn more about my specific skills or just want to get in contact with me, feel free to browse to the resume and contact pages!
