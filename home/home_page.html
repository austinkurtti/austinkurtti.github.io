                    Welcome! My name is Austin Kurtti and I currently live in Lawrence, Kansas as an undergraduate student at the University of Kansas. I am pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Business with the intent to graduate in the spring of 2017.<br><br>Before coming to KU, I was inspired to become an electrical engineer through participation in my high school's engineering club. After the first semester of classes my freshman year, I wasn't as excited to continue with engineering as I thought I would be. But with the help of my first programming class in my second semester, I had discovered what I really wanted to study. Within the first couple weeks of that class, I found myself wanting more homework and I could tell I was once again excited to stay in the engineering program. I had always viewed programming as a difficult foreign language that didn't make any sense, until I realized it's something I love. Before I knew it, I had submitted my request to change majors from electrical engineering to computer science.<br><br>In February of 2014, I started a job with AllofE Solutions in Lawrence, Kansas as a web development intern. After working at AllofE for over a year, I have learned that web design is what I truly enjoy the most. With two years left in my academic career, I look forward to continuing my studies at KU and learning more about the web development industry through my internship with AllofE.
