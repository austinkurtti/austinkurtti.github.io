                    This is a personal project of mine that sprouted from my desire for a better school management app. There are some decent choices out there that help keep you organized when it comes to homework, tests, and projects, but I wanted something more customizable and flexible. My solution was to make my own app! Major features it will include are homework, exam, and project trackers with extensive reminder and notification tools, schedule and graduation progress management, and a class directory.<br>Working on this app gives me an opportunity to learn more about Android and mobile application development. Right now it is more of a hobby, but if it turns out well I will likely publish it to the Google Play store for free to share with others.

                    This very website is an ongoing project of mine. I am constantly looking to improve it's functionality and design as I learn more about website development. Feedback is welcome!
